I'm a Software Development Engineer-2 at Adobe where I ideate, develop, optimize and deploy Machine Learning models for Adobe Scan. I graduated from Delhi Technological University in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. I have a keen interest in research in Natural Language Processing and am intrigued by the insights that can be gleaned from data.

Research
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. My goal is to build interpretable deep learning models that are more conducive to reducing societal bias. My research at MIDAS Lab was focused in NLP where I published papers at top conferences including EMNLP, Interspeech and NAACL.
