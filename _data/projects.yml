- title: "MouseEye"
  description: "A utility application that allows differently abled users to interact with interfaces by performing mouse-clicks using eye blinks. It detects the facial landmarks & calculates the eye aspect ratio using dlib's landmark detector implemented using Histogram of Gradients and linear SVM. Developed using OpenCV."

- title: "Mobile Scan App"
  description: "Implemented a document scanner using OpenCV to convert snapshots of real world documents into clear, sharp multi-page PDFâ€™s. Detects the largest contours in the user input image and performs an affine transform to warp the image to a rectangle. After that, thresholding is performed to make the document clearer giving it the digital touch."

- title: "Facial Expression Recognition System"
  description: "Created an image classifier to classify facial expressions in photos into 7 classes like happy, sad, angry etc. Applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that achieved an accuracy of 63%. This can be integrated with other pipelines like music generation, to generate music based on mood."
